## Project Description

Onyx AI Assistant leverages the power of AI to create an interactive and versatile virtual assistant. It comes equipped with long-term memory, enabling it to recall past interactions and recognize users. Onyx can execute a variety of tasks, such as managing GitHub repositories, analyzing visual input through a camera, answering questions about objects in view, and performing Google Lens searches. This makes Onyx ideal for hands-free assistance with coding, research, and even personal management tasks.

## Features

- **Long-Term Memory**: Uses persistent memory storage to remember interactions over time.
- **Face Recognition**: Recognizes users' faces to personalize responses.
- **Camera Interaction**: Can detect and describe objects in view, answer questions based on visual input, and perform Google Lens-like searches.
- **Screen Analysis**: Identifies elements on the screen and responds to user queries about visible content.
- **GitHub Integration**: Can create and clone repositories, facilitating seamless interaction with GitHub.
  
## Installation

### Clone and Setup

To get started, clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Divyanshu9822/onyx-ai-assistant.git
cd onyx-ai-assistant
```

### Environment Setup

   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Using Conda (optional)**
   ```powershell
   conda create -n onyx_env python=3.x
   conda activate onyx_env
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

#### For Linux/Mac Users

1. **Using Python's Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Using Conda (optional)**
   ```bash
   conda create -n onyx_env python=3.x
   conda activate onyx_env
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Run the Application

To start the Onyx AI Assistant, run:

```bash
python main.py
```
